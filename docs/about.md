# About me

Howdy, y'all! My name is **Henry Díaz Bordón**, and I'm a programmer and, above all, mathematics enthusiast currently based in Spain. My main interests are code and math, of course, but also working out and gaming.

I'm also really into <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">soccer</span> football, being a <span style="font-size: 150%;">HUGE</span> fan of <span style="color: gold;">Real</span> <span style="color: white;">Madrid</span>; one could say it was my first true love, although I enjoy other sports as well, such as Track and Cross Country (even though I'm not very good at them).

# Education
I'm not yet a college graduate, but hopefully, I'll remedy that soon. However, in the long journey my education has been, I have achieved quite a few accomplishments I am very fond of:

* I am an officially gifted student, landing in the 99th percentile in mathematic intelligence.
* I earned the [Amancio Ortega scholarship](https://becas.faortega.org/), which allowed me to study for a year in my dream country, namely, the <span style="background-color: black;"><span style="color: blue;">U</span><span style="color: red;">S</span><span style="color: white;">A</span></span>. 
* I have a C2 certificate in English (which supposedly demonstrates proficiency, despite my funny writing).

# Projects
In the meantime, I divert myself to making (arguably) fun code projects, and my top favorites are listed below:

* [Interferencias:](https://h3nry-d1az.github.io/interferencias/) Wave interference simulator (in <span style="color: red;">Sp</span><span style="color: yellow;">ani</span><span style="color: red;">sh</span>). 
* [Cavendish:](https://github.com/h3nry-d1az/cavendish) Yet another gravitational physics simulator.
* [hngin:](https://github.com/h3nry-d1az/hngin) An attempt to implement a 3D rendering engine based on pure intuition and linear algebra.

If you are looking for more professional work, make sure to check out my [publications](publications.md) page, I believe you'll find what you want there.

# TODO: Near future
In the future, I would like to pursue a degree in \\(\text{mathematics}\:\lor\:\text{computer science}\\) -- notice this is a disjunctive (not exclusive) or, so hopefully both --, my third option is telecommunications engineering, which to be honest, sounds like a great plan.
