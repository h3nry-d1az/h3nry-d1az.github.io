# About me

Hello everyone! My name is **Henry Díaz Bordón**, and I'm a programmer and, above all, mathematics enthusiast currently based in Spain. My main interests are code and math, of course, but also working out and gaming.

I'm also really into <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">soccer</span> football, being a <span style="font-size: 150%;">HUGE</span> fan of <span style="color: gold;">Real</span> <span style="color: white;">Madrid</span>; one could say it was my first true love, although I enjoy other sports as well, such as Track and Cross Country (even though I'm not very good at them).

# Education
I'm currently studying \\(\text{mathematics}\:\land\:\text{computing}\\) at [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid](https://www.uc3m.es/bachelor-degree/mathematics-computing) (UC3M). However, in the exciting journey my education has been so far, I have achieved a few accomplishments I am very fond of:

* I am an officially gifted student, landing in the 99th percentile in mathematic intelligence.
* I earned the [Amancio Ortega scholarship](https://becas.faortega.org/), which allowed me to study for a year in my dream country, namely, the <span style="background-color: black;"><span style="color: blue;">U</span><span style="color: red;">S</span><span style="color: white;">A</span></span>. 
* I have a C2 certificate in English (which supposedly demonstrates proficiency, despite my funny writing).

# Projects
In the meantime, I divert myself to making (arguably) fun code projects, and my top favorites are listed below:

* [PNPL:](https://esolangs.org/wiki/PNPL) an esoteric language based on the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.
* [Interferencias:](https://h3nry-d1az.github.io/interferencias/) Wave interference simulator (in <span style="color: red;">Sp</span><span style="color: yellow;">ani</span><span style="color: red;">sh</span>). 
* [Cavendish:](https://github.com/h3nry-d1az/cavendish) Yet another gravitational physics simulator.
* [hngin:](https://h3nry-d1az.itch.io/hngin) An attempt to implement a 3D rendering engine based on pure intuition and linear algebra.
* [hShip:](https://h3nry-d1az.itch.io/hship) A tiny ships game made of ASCII characters.
