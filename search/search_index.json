This is a project made to my delight, so if you are a number enthusiast, and you like coding arguably obscure algorithms in even weirder languages, you are very welcome to jump aboard! Otherwise, I'm afraid this may not be the right place for you to stop by. But don't be sad, there are plenty more fish in the sea . As I was saying, these will be the main topics I will cover in this blog, yet not the only ones by any means! So expect this place to be a wild card in terms of content -- completely subject to whatever (and whenever) I feel like posting. What can I expect? Well, firstly, as I said, there are no rules in this place but whatever I'm up to. However, it is true that I'm kind of a narrow-minded person, and so I have a very particular taste in the aforementioned disciplines. I'm an avid \\(\\TeX\\) user with a preference for functional programming languages, although most of the time I keep writing everything in Python (or rewriting it in Rust). I'm also into graphics and videogames programming, but that's a story for another post... In terms of math, I do have a strange fascination with set theory, but I'm well aware that it isn't a real thing, but rather an invention mathematicians have made up in order to preserve their jobs. In conclusion, the following maxim pretty much summarizes what your thoughts should be when reading one of my articles \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af: \u201cNo expectations mean there is no risk of disappointment.\u201d Can I subscribe? Not currently, I'm very inexperienced with RSS Feed, so it's probably going to take a little while if not forever. In the meantime, why don't you just sit back, relax, and enjoy one of my posts? (I've heard they are quite good.) What a cool aesthetic! Thanks! It's not mine, though. The original theme was BOOSTRA.386 , by Lucas Ramage -- which I forked in order to add \\(\\LaTeX\\) support, syntax highlighting (which, by the way, is not working, and it's driving me nuts) and other fancy functionalities tailored to my needs. I didn't choose it because of the nostalgia -- in fact, I ain't even a 90s kid -- but rather because I find cool the MS-DOS look (and not yet very popular). In conclusion, all credit regarding this aspect of my website belongs to him. So what are you waiting for?

My name is Henry D\u00edaz Bord\u00f3n , and I'm a programmer and, above all, mathematics enthusiast currently based in Spain. My main interests are code and math, of course, but also working out and gaming. I'm also really into soccer football, being a HUGE fan of Real Madrid ; one could say it was my first true love, although I enjoy other sports as well, such as Track and Cross Country (even though I'm not very good at them). Education I'm not yet a college graduate, but hopefully, I'll remedy that soon. However, in the long journey my education has been, I have achieved quite a few accomplishments I am very fond of: I am an officially gifted student, landing in the 99th percentile in mathematic intelligence. I earned the Amancio Ortega scholarship , which allowed me to study for a year in my dream country, namely, the U S A . I have a C2 certificate in English (which supposedly demonstrates proficiency, despite my funny writing). Projects In the meantime, I divert myself to making (arguably) fun code projects, and my top favorites are listed below: \u029c\u0274\u0262\u026a\u0274: An attempt to implement a 3D rendering engine based on pure intuition and linear algebra. If you are looking for more professional work, make sure to check out my publications page, I believe you'll find what you want there. TODO: Near future In the future, I would like to pursue a degree in \\(\\text{mathematics}\\:\\lor\\:\\text{computer science}\\) -- notice this is a disjunctive (not exclusive) or, so hopefully both --, my third option is telecommunications engineering, which to be honest, sounds like a great plan.
