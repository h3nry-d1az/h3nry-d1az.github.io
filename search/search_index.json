It probably owes its popularity to its early discovery by the sculptor Phidias back in Ancient Greece, or to the fact that it emerges from the study of something as natural as proportions are, and it could even be a cause of its manifold, beautiful representations and its unexpected apparitions in nature. Nonetheless, and despite its major transcendence, it is a concept even a child could fathom, and with a relatively straightforward definition: Mathematically correct definition In order to determine the golden ratio, we must first understand what a golden proportion is per se: It is said that two lengths are in golden proportion if the ratio between the two combined and the longest equals the ratio between the longest and the shortest. That is, if \\(a > b\\), then \\(\\frac{a+b}{a} = \\frac{a}{b}\\). If you've just gotten dizzy, let me tell you not to worry, because at first glance this statement may seem sort of abstract -- since we have not defined an actual constant, but rather a relationship that can be satisfied by infinite numbers --. Furthermore, it's phrased in more rigorous mathematical terminology, which hides its beautiful geometric intuition; so, to solve these two problems, let's start again and define this concept one more time. Geometric definition Suppose we have two differently-sized rods, which we'll call \\(a\\) to the longest and \\(b\\) to the shortest. Let's now put them together, yielding a new one with length \\(a+b\\), just like it is shown below: \\begin{tikzpicture} \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=red] (AB_1) at (-2, 0) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=red] (AB_2) at (-2, -1.62) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=blue] (AB_3) at (-2, -2.62) {}; \\draw[color = red] (AB_1) -- (AB_2); \\draw[color = blue] (AB_2) -- (AB_3); \\node[white] at (-1.75, -0.90) {$a$}; \\node[white] at (-1.75, -1.73) {$b$}; \\node[white] at (-1.75, -1.31) {$+$}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=red] (A_1) at (0, -0.5) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=red] (A_2) at (0, -2.12) {}; \\draw[red] (A_1) -- (A_2); \\node[white] at (0.25, -1.31) {$a$}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=blue] (B_1) at (2, -0.81) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=blue] (B_2) at (2, -1.81) {}; \\draw[blue] (B_1) -- (B_2); \\node[white] at (2.25, -1.31) {$b$}; \\end{tikzpicture} Notice an interesting property of the previous image, namely that comparing the newly-constructed stick \\(a+b\\) with \\(a\\) is like measuring \\(a\\) against \\(b\\), but in a reduced scale. They are in the same proportion! Now, it is true that I have selected this detail deliberately, and not all bars satisfy this property, so we'll say that the \\(a,b\\) that do verify it are in golden proportion . This is the true motivation behind the earlier definition. It now makes way more sense, doesn't it? But, as we mentioned in the beginning, the golden ratio is a constant , not an infinite group of numbers that meet a property, and its magnitude is precisely the earlier quotient of both lengths. We've now got all the tools we need to find its exact value: All the numbers in golden proportion have as ratio \\(\\frac{1+\\sqrt5}{2}\\). As we stated above, this value is commonly represented as \\(\\varphi\\) in honor of the aforementioned Phidias, and I won't be making an exception here. Replacing then \\(\\varphi\\) for \\(a/b\\) in the first definition and simplifying we reach the following equality: $$ \\begin{align*} \\frac{a}{b}&=\\frac{a+b}{a}\\implies\\frac{a}{b}=1+\\frac{b}{a}\\\\ &\\implies \\varphi = 1 + \\varphi^{-1}\\\\ &\\implies \\varphi^2 = \\varphi + 1\\\\ &\\implies \\varphi^2 - \\varphi - 1 = 0 \\end{align*} $$ Which is a classic quadratic equation that any high school student could solve, so it will suffice to employ Bhaskara's formula: $$ \\begin{align*} \\varphi &= \\frac{-(-1)\\pm\\sqrt{(-1)^2-4\\cdot(1)\\cdot(-1)}}{2\\cdot(1)} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\end{align*} $$ Nevertheless, \\(\\varphi\\) must be positive, since we are dealing with a ratio of positive numbers, therefore we can discard the second solution: $$\\varphi = \\frac{1+\\sqrt5}{2}$$ The other remaining value is called the conjugate of \\(\\varphi\\), because it has the sign of the second summand inverted. It is usually denoted by \\(\\tilde\\varphi\\) and, in a enthralling manner, it holds that \\(\\tilde\\varphi = -\\frac{1}{\\varphi} = 1-\\varphi\\). To conclude this section, below are listed a hundred significant figures of this curious constant: 1. 6 1 8 0339887 4989484820 4586834365 6381177203 0917980576 2862135448 6227052604 6281890244 9707207204 1893911374\u2026 The metallic numbers But, why stop here? Sure the golden ratio is such an interesting concept, but will it be the only value with similar characteristics? The solution to this unknown are the \"metallic numbers\", whose structure we'll study next, and whose name alludes to the gold in golden ratio . The golden ratio, revisited Recall the geometric definition for a golden proportion we came up with, and let's put the rods \\(a+b\\) and \\(a\\) perpendicularly, forming a rectangle like the following: \\begin{tikzpicture} \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=red] (A_1) at (0, 0) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=red] (A_2) at (0, -2) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=red] (AB_1) at (2, -2) {}; \\node (AB_null) at (2, 0) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=blue] (AB_2) at (3.24, -2) {}; \\node (AB_2_null) at (3.24, 0) {}; \\draw[color = red, fill=red!35] (A_1.center) -- (A_2.center) -- (AB_1.center) -- (AB_null.center) -- cycle; \\draw[color = blue, fill=blue!35] (AB_1.center) -- (AB_2.center) -- (AB_2_null.center) -- (AB_null.center) -- cycle; \\node[white] at (1, -2.39) {$a$}; \\node[white] at (2.62, -2.35) {$b$}; \\node[white] at (2, -2.35) {$+$}; \\node[white] at (-0.35, -1) {$a$}; \\end{tikzpicture} Let's now detach the blue rectangle from the former and see what happens: \\begin{tikzpicture} \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=red] (A_1) at (0, 0) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=red] (A_2) at (0, -2) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=red] (AB_1) at (2, -2) {}; \\node (AB_null) at (2, 0) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=blue] (AB_2) at (3.24, -2) {}; \\node (AB_2_null) at (3.24, 0) {}; \\draw[color = red, fill=red!35] (A_1.center) -- (A_2.center) -- (AB_1.center) -- (AB_null.center) -- cycle; \\draw[color = blue, fill=blue!35] (AB_1.center) -- (AB_2.center) -- (AB_2_null.center) -- (AB_null.center) -- cycle; \\node[white] at (1, -2.39) {$a$}; \\node[white] at (2.62, -2.35) {$b$}; \\node[white] at (2, -2.35) {$+$}; \\node[white] at (-0.35, -1) {$a$}; \\node[white] at (4.24, -1) {$\\longrightarrow$}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=blue] (B_1) at (5.59, -0.38) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=blue] (B_2) at (5.59, -1.62) {}; \\node (B_4) at (7.59, -0.38) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=blue] (B_3) at (7.59, -1.62) {}; \\draw[color = blue, fill=blue!35] (B_1.center) -- (B_2.center) -- (B_3.center) -- (B_4.center) -- cycle; \\node[white] at (5.24, -1) {$b$}; \\node[white] at (6.59, -1.97) {$a$}; \\end{tikzpicture} Like the lengths from our old definition, the new rectangle is equal to the previous one, but deescalated; that is, they are both proportional to one another. This new property is equivalent to the earlier definition and, perhaps, even more visual. Furthermore, it'll be our starting point to generalize the golden ratio. Just as a curiosity, the DIN A x paper formats are based upon a similar idea, but in that case, the proportion is \\(\\sqrt2\\), because cutting in half a DIN A3 produces two DIN A4, a DIN A4 two DIN A5, and so forth. Can you show why this is the ratio? (Hint: use the proof for the theorem we have just discussed.) Definition of the metallic numbers Allow me to go back to the previous rectangle and tweak it slightly. What if I wanted a rectangle with this same property, but more stretched? At first glance, one may wonder: \u201cWhy would I want something like this?\u201d but this shape would have numerous applications, combining the robustness of the former with dimensions more suitable for certain situations. By our previous theorem, something exactly equal is impossible, yet we can apply a little trick to obtain what we're looking for: \\begin{tikzpicture} \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=red] (A_1) at (0, 0) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=red] (A_2) at (0, -2.41) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=red] (AB_1) at (4.82, -2.41) {}; \\node (AB_null) at (4.82, 0) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=blue] (AB_2) at (5.82, -2.41) {}; \\node (AB_2_null) at (5.82, 0) {}; \\draw[color = red, fill=red!35] (A_1.center) -- (A_2.center) -- (AB_1.center) -- (AB_null.center) -- cycle; \\draw[color = blue, fill=blue!35] (AB_1.center) -- (AB_2.center) -- (AB_2_null.center) -- (AB_null.center) -- cycle; \\node[white] at (2.41, -2.76) {$2a$}; \\node[white] at (5.32, -2.76) {$b$}; \\node[white] at (4.82, -2.76) {$+$}; \\node[white] at (-0.35, -1.205) {$a$}; \\end{tikzpicture} Multiplying the \\(a\\) of the longer segment by a constant yields something along those lines. And the number two here isn't special at all, it could very well be a 3, a 4, or generalizing , any given \\(n\\)! However, we stumble upon a small problem, being that varying the longitude of the segments changes our proportion too, so the golden ratio would take a new value in this case, although it would receive the name of golden ratio , but rather we shall call it a metallic number . In general, the metallic number resulting from multiplying \\(a\\) by \\(n\\) will be called the nth metallic number. Finding the nth metallic number Before proceeding with the computations, let's introduce some notation to summarize with more precision and rigor the geometric concept we've been developing until now: The nth metallic number, denoted \\(\\mu_n\\), is defined as the quotient \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\), where the values \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) verify the following relationship: $$\\frac{a}{b}=\\frac{na+b}{a}$$ I've chosen the Greek letter \\(\\mu_n\\) to represent this collection, since metal in Ancient Greek is \u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd, and these were the discoverers of this idea; although it is worth pointing out that it can be seen represented as \\(A(n)\\), and virtually as other variations of which I'm unaware. Regardless, armed with the previous definition and the proof of the first theorem, we can once and for all find a general expression for \\(\\mu_n\\): The nth metallic number has as value $$\\mu_n = \\frac{n+\\sqrt{n^2+4}}{2}.$$ Recalling the definition of a metallic number, we have that: $$ \\begin{align*} \\frac{a}{b}&=\\frac{na+b}{a}\\implies\\frac{a}{b}=n+\\frac{b}{a}\\\\ &\\implies \\mu_n = n + {\\mu_n}^{-1}\\\\ &\\implies {\\mu_n}^2 = n{\\mu_n} + 1\\\\ &\\implies {\\mu_n}^2 - n{\\mu_n} - 1 = 0 \\end{align*} $$ Which is yet another quadratic equation with an easy solution: $$ \\begin{align*} \\mu_n &= \\frac{-(-n)\\pm\\sqrt{(-n)^2-4\\cdot(1)\\cdot(-1)}}{2\\cdot(1)}\\\\ &= \\frac{n\\pm\\sqrt{n^2+4}}{2} \\end{align*} $$ And since all \\(\\mu_n\\) have to be greater than zero -- because they denote the ratio of two positive quantities --, we can discard with no fear the negative roots: $$\\mu_n = \\frac{n+\\sqrt{n^2+4}}{2}$$ As it was to be proven. The first five metallic numbers already have a name (and even symbol), being the following : .tg {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;} .tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px; overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;11 font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg .tg-axxb{background-color:#c0c0c0;border-color:inherit;color:#000000;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-c3ow{border-color:inherit;text-align:center;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-2yfi{background-color:#c0c0c0;border-color:inherit;color:#000000;text-align:center;vertical-align:top} \\(n\\) Metal Symbol Exact value Approximated value 1 Gold \\(\\varphi\\) \\(\\frac{1+\\sqrt5}{2}\\) 1.618033989\u2026 2 Silver \\(\\delta_S\\) \\(1+\\sqrt2\\) 2.414213562\u2026 3 Bronze \\(\\delta_{\\text{Br}}\\) \\(\\frac{3+\\sqrt{13}}{2}\\) 3.302775638\u2026 4 Copper \\(\\delta_{\\text{Cu}}\\) \\(2+\\sqrt5\\) 4.236067978\u2026 5 Nickel \\(\\delta_{\\text{Ni}}\\) \\(\\frac{5+\\sqrt{29}}{2}\\) 5.192582404\u2026 Nonetheless, the remaining infinite ones have neither an official, recognized nickname, nor an associated symbol, so I can take for example \\(\\mu_{14}=7+5\\sqrt{2}\\), and hereby name it Henry's number , giving it the symbol \\(\\mathfrak h\\). And, of course, you can do this same thing as well. Abstraction in mathematics There's a quote from the great mathematician J. Henri Poincar\u00e9 which, from my perspective, brings together exceptionally the main idea of this essay: \"Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things.\" And it is true that the spirit of a mathematician isn't fulfilled with discovering an interesting property, but craves to explore the limits of their finding, thus expanding it in such a way that what was earlier thought as a whole, now it isn't but a special case of a more robust theory, which englobes entities formerly unrelated but now connected. This process receives the name of abstraction or generalization and, although in principle can appear confusing and useless, it is one of the more powerful tools mathematicians have at their disposal and, more importantly, the fire that fuels their work.

Let's now put them together, yielding a new one with length \\(a+b\\), just like it is shown below: \\begin{tikzpicture} \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=red] (AB_1) at (-2, 0) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=red] (AB_2) at (-2, -1.62) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=blue] (AB_3) at (-2, -2.62) {}; \\draw[color = red] (AB_1) -- (AB_2); \\draw[color = blue] (AB_2) -- (AB_3); \\node[white] at (-1.75, -0.90) {$a$}; \\node[white] at (-1.75, -1.73) {$b$}; \\node[white] at (-1.75, -1.31) {$+$}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=red] (A_1) at (0, -0.5) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=red] (A_2) at (0, -2.12) {}; \\draw[red] (A_1) -- (A_2); \\node[white] at (0.25, -1.31) {$a$}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=blue] (B_1) at (2, -0.81) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=blue] (B_2) at (2, -1.81) {}; \\draw[blue] (B_1) -- (B_2); \\node[white] at (2.25, -1.31) {$b$}; \\end{tikzpicture} Notice an interesting property of the previous image, namely that comparing the newly-constructed stick \\(a+b\\) with \\(a\\) is like measuring \\(a\\) against \\(b\\), but in a reduced scale. They are in the same proportion! Now, it is true that I have selected this detail deliberately, and not all bars satisfy this property, so we'll say that the \\(a,b\\) that do verify it are in golden proportion . This is the true motivation behind the earlier definition. It now makes way more sense, doesn't it? But, as we mentioned in the beginning, the golden ratio is a constant , not an infinite group of numbers that meet a property, and its magnitude is precisely the earlier quotient of both lengths. We've now got all the tools we need to find its exact value: All the numbers in golden proportion have as ratio \\(\\frac{1+\\sqrt5}{2}\\). As we stated above, this value is commonly represented as \\(\\varphi\\) in honor of the aforementioned Phidias, and I won't be making an exception here. Replacing then \\(\\varphi\\) for \\(a/b\\) in the first definition and simplifying we reach the following equality: $$ \\begin{align*} \\frac{a}{b}&=\\frac{a+b}{a}\\implies\\frac{a}{b}=1+\\frac{b}{a}\\\\ &\\implies \\varphi = 1 + \\varphi^{-1}\\\\ &\\implies \\varphi^2 = \\varphi + 1\\\\ &\\implies \\varphi^2 - \\varphi - 1 = 0 \\end{align*} $$ Which is a classic quadratic equation that any high school student could solve, so it will suffice to employ Bhaskara's formula: $$ \\begin{align*} \\varphi &= \\frac{-(-1)\\pm\\sqrt{(-1)^2-4\\cdot(1)\\cdot(-1)}}{2\\cdot(1)} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\end{align*} $$ Nevertheless, \\(\\varphi\\) must be positive, since we are dealing with a ratio of positive numbers, therefore we can discard the second solution: $$\\varphi = \\frac{1+\\sqrt5}{2}$$ The other remaining value is called the conjugate of \\(\\varphi\\), because it has the sign of the second summand inverted. It is usually denoted by \\(\\tilde\\varphi\\) and, in a enthralling manner, it holds that \\(\\tilde\\varphi = -\\frac{1}{\\varphi} = 1-\\varphi\\).

Regardless, armed with the previous definition and the proof of the first theorem, we can once and for all find a general expression for \\(\\mu_n\\): The nth metallic number has as value $$\\mu_n = \\frac{n+\\sqrt{n^2+4}}{2}.$$ Recalling the definition of a metallic number, we have that: $$ \\begin{align*} \\frac{a}{b}&=\\frac{na+b}{a}\\implies\\frac{a}{b}=n+\\frac{b}{a}\\\\ &\\implies \\mu_n = n + {\\mu_n}^{-1}\\\\ &\\implies {\\mu_n}^2 = n{\\mu_n} + 1\\\\ &\\implies {\\mu_n}^2 - n{\\mu_n} - 1 = 0 \\end{align*} $$ Which is yet another quadratic equation with an easy solution: $$ \\begin{align*} \\mu_n &= \\frac{-(-n)\\pm\\sqrt{(-n)^2-4\\cdot(1)\\cdot(-1)}}{2\\cdot(1)}\\\\ &= \\frac{n\\pm\\sqrt{n^2+4}}{2} \\end{align*} $$ And since all \\(\\mu_n\\) have to be greater than zero -- because they denote the ratio of two positive quantities --, we can discard with no fear the negative roots: $$\\mu_n = \\frac{n+\\sqrt{n^2+4}}{2}$$ As it was to be proven.

What may surprise those unseasoned with low-level math, is that ZF(C) only defines set theory , and the rest, the entirety of the vast ecosystem of mathematics, is defined as sets and sets of sets .

It actually consists of infinite axioms, but don't worry, this is because it makes use of a little trick called axiomatic schemes , but let's not get ahead of ourselves and start from the beginning. Paradoxically, ZF does not give any definition at all for the concept of set , but if you think about it twice, it really doesn't have to! If I tell you that all bulls have horns, and I tell you I've got a bull, you can properly conclude that my creature has indeed horns. You do not need the subjects to do the logic, logic itself is enough!

That's pretty much what a set is. By the way, I will be writing down the statement in both plain English and formal logic, you are not required to know the latter, but I include it for the seasoned (and because I believe that, if you stare at them for long enough, you'll eventually learn some logic, c'mon, I believe in you). Anyway, here they go: Axiom of Extensionality : Two sets are equal if they have the same elements: $$\\forall X \\forall Y \\forall u (u \\in X \\iff u \\in Y) \\implies X = Y.$$ As I said, it does really seem trivial, but in the beginning there is nothing that ensures this proposition is true, so we just have to assume it. Axiom of the empty set : There exists a set with nothing in it: $$\\exists \\varnothing \\forall x (x \\notin \\varnothing).$$ Axiom of Pairing : For any two sets there exists another that contains only those two: $$\\forall X \\forall Y \\exists \\{X,Y\\} \\forall a (a \\in \\{X,Y\\} \\iff (a = X \\lor a = Y)).$$ Axiom of Comprehension : If we have a set and a property, we can sieve the ones that meet it and put them in another set: $$\\forall X \\exists Y \\forall u (u \\in Y \\iff (u \\in X \\land \\phi(u)))$$ Axiom of the Power Set : For a given set, we can construct the set with all its subsets (sounds complicated but think about it twice): $$\\forall X \\exists \\mathscr{P}X \\forall u (u \\in \\mathscr P X \\iff (\\forall v (v \\in u \\implies v \\in X))).$$ ... I'm not going to list them all because it will be both boring and redundant since they are already out there on the internet , and most importantly, because there is no need to provided this is not the main focus of this article. The story behind type theory To understand why type theory even exists, we need to go back to the late 1800s and early 1900s when the attempt to find those \"building blocks\" of mathematics was at its peak. By then, a mathematician named Gottlob Frege proposed his own theory, which rapidly became very popular, until another mathematician, with name Bertrand Russell, found a flaw in Frege's axioms, the infamous Russell's paradox . One of Frege's assumptions was that, given any (formal) statement, there existed a set containing all the sets that met it, so Russell said -- and here I paraphrase -- : \"Oh yeah? So what about the property: '\\(x \\notin x\\)' (\\(x\\) is not in \\(x\\))?\" Which completely obliterated Frege's work. Let's think about why: For the rest of the sets, there should be no problem, either they satisfy the property or they don't, but it shouldn't be a big deal. For the big, container set, however, we have two options: The big set contains itself, and thus by our assumption the big set is not included in the big set. The big set doesn't contain itself, and thus by our assumption the big set is included in itself. One can see then that the former case leads to the latter, and the latter to the former in an infinite loop that is nothing but a HUGE contradiction. This clearly had to be fixed, so mathematicians back in the day began working on the issue. The year is 1908, and two landmark papers are published. First, Zermelo's famous proposal, but Russell had his own idea two, what nowadays is known as type theory , and now, in the XXI century is achieving its prime popularity. Type theory as an alternative If you have ever coded in a statically typed language, you sort of know what this business is all about. We have elements, namely \\(a, b, x, y, \\ldots\\), -- which correspond to variables -- that can belong to a collection named type . We denote this ownership by $$x: \\mathtt{type},$$ just like you would in Rust or TypeScript. Note that functions are still a thing, so for example, $$f: \\mathtt{t}_1 \\rightarrow \\mathtt{t}_2$$ is an object that takes an input from a type \\(\\mathtt{t}_1\\) and returns another from a type \\(\\mathtt{t}_2\\). Furthermore, \\(\\mathtt{t}_1 \\rightarrow \\mathtt{t}_2\\) is a type as well, and so is \\(\\mathtt{t}_1 \\times \\mathtt{t}_2\\), and so forth. With all this, type theory becomes a very robust framework, and the magic comes when we stop thinking of types as sets , and start thinking of them as propositions . Then, a member of the type will be a proof of the proposition, and the compound types \\(\\mathtt{t}_1 \\rightarrow \\mathtt{t}_2\\) and \\(\\mathtt{t}_1 \\times \\mathtt{t}_2\\) represent implication and conjunction respectively. It is because of this comfortable correspondence with logic that type theory has been brought out of the \"building blocks\" scenario to work on more profitable contexts, the most important of which are proof assistants . Introducing Lean Proof assistants are a marvelous, time-saving invention, they are basically programming languages in which you write the proof of your theorem, and it spits out whether it's correct or not, using type theory for the duty. It's like having a [very pedantic] little fella next to you all the time, that ensures -- with a mathematically proven reliability -- that you are making no mistakes. They appeared quite a while ago, one of the most popular, Coq (yes, that's its name, I won't argue it's quite funny), was first released back in 1989, but it is mainly because of the apparition of Lean that they are experiencing a renaissance. The latter, at least for my inexperienced taste, is far more elegant than the former, here is an example from the Natural Number Game about the associativity of the natural numbers, in my opinion, the best online resource for learning this tool: theorem mul_assoc ( a b c : \u2115 ) : ( a * b ) * c = a * ( b * c ) := by induction c with k h\u2096 repeat rw [ mul_zero ] repeat rw [ mul_zero ] rfl rw [ mul_succ , mul_succ , mul_add , h\u2096 ] rfl You do not need to fully understand the proof, but simply notice the built-in induction statement, the easy support for Unicode characters, and, if you use Visual Studio Code, the amazing error spotting it provides. It may seem a hard tool to master at first glance, and indeed it is not easy, but surely it is not a waste of time either. \"Perfect\" Mathematics This begs the question: \"Can we ensure our mathematics are flawless using proof assistants?\" The answer is sadly no because of G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems, but what we can do is to prove that, provided our assumptions, our proofs are valid, and there's a devoted collective out there trying to accomplish this dream. The proofs already exist, we just need to formalize them! To close off, I would like to mention a project that is being carried out by the Imperial College of London, and which I do genuinely like, which is to formalize Fermat's Last Theorem in Lean.","title":"Type Theory, Lean, and \"Perfect\" Mathematics"},{"location":"posts/2024/perfect-mathematics/#type-theory-lean-and-perfect-mathematics","text":"Sep 30, 2024 One may think of mathematics as a colossal, millennia-old Lego building; maybe not one with plentiful colors, or numerous figurines decorating the scenery, and possibly even lacking any sort of interesting shape, but surely one in which each building block corresponds to a different result or fact -- for example, you could think of Euclid's division lemma and Stokes' theorem as yet another blocks that support the weight of many others.

Axiom of the empty set : There exists a set with nothing in it: $$\\exists \\varnothing \\forall x (x \\notin \\varnothing).$$ Axiom of Pairing : For any two sets there exists another that contains only those two: $$\\forall X \\forall Y \\exists \\{X,Y\\} \\forall a (a \\in \\{X,Y\\} \\iff (a = X \\lor a = Y)).$$ Axiom of Comprehension : If we have a set and a property, we can sieve the ones that meet it and put them in another set: $$\\forall X \\exists Y \\forall u (u \\in Y \\iff (u \\in X \\land \\phi(u)))$$ Axiom of the Power Set : For a given set, we can construct the set with all its subsets (sounds complicated but think about it twice): $$\\forall X \\exists \\mathscr{P}X \\forall u (u \\in \\mathscr P X \\iff (\\forall v (v \\in u \\implies v \\in X))).$$ ... I'm not going to list them all because it will be both boring and redundant since they are already out there on the internet , and most importantly, because there is no need to provided this is not the main focus of this article.","title":"The axioms of ZF(C)"},{"location":"posts/2024/perfect-mathematics/#the-story-behind-type-theory","text":"To understand why type theory even exists, we need to go back to the late 1800s and early 1900s when the attempt to find those \"building blocks\" of mathematics was at its peak. By then, a mathematician named Gottlob Frege proposed his own theory, which rapidly became very popular, until another mathematician, with name Bertrand Russell, found a flaw in Frege's axioms, the infamous Russell's paradox . One of Frege's assumptions was that, given any (formal) statement, there existed a set containing all the sets that met it, so Russell said -- and here I paraphrase -- : \"Oh yeah? So what about the property: '\\(x \\notin x\\)' (\\(x\\) is not in \\(x\\))?\" Which completely obliterated Frege's work. Let's think about why: For the rest of the sets, there should be no problem, either they satisfy the property or they don't, but it shouldn't be a big deal. For the big, container set, however, we have two options: The big set contains itself, and thus by our assumption the big set is not included in the big set. The big set doesn't contain itself, and thus by our assumption the big set is included in itself. One can see then that the former case leads to the latter, and the latter to the former in an infinite loop that is nothing but a HUGE contradiction. This clearly had to be fixed, so mathematicians back in the day began working on the issue. The year is 1908, and two landmark papers are published. First, Zermelo's famous proposal, but Russell had his own idea two, what nowadays is known as type theory , and now, in the XXI century is achieving its prime popularity.","title":"The story behind type theory"},{"location":"posts/2024/perfect-mathematics/#type-theory-as-an-alternative","text":"If you have ever coded in a statically typed language, you sort of know what this business is all about. We have elements, namely \\(a, b, x, y, \\ldots\\), -- which correspond to variables -- that can belong to a collection named type . We denote this ownership by $$x: \\mathtt{type},$$ just like you would in Rust or TypeScript. Note that functions are still a thing, so for example, $$f: \\mathtt{t}_1 \\rightarrow \\mathtt{t}_2$$ is an object that takes an input from a type \\(\\mathtt{t}_1\\) and returns another from a type \\(\\mathtt{t}_2\\). Furthermore, \\(\\mathtt{t}_1 \\rightarrow \\mathtt{t}_2\\) is a type as well, and so is \\(\\mathtt{t}_1 \\times \\mathtt{t}_2\\), and so forth. With all this, type theory becomes a very robust framework, and the magic comes when we stop thinking of types as sets , and start thinking of them as propositions . Then, a member of the type will be a proof of the proposition, and the compound types \\(\\mathtt{t}_1 \\rightarrow \\mathtt{t}_2\\) and \\(\\mathtt{t}_1 \\times \\mathtt{t}_2\\) represent implication and conjunction respectively. It is because of this comfortable correspondence with logic that type theory has been brought out of the \"building blocks\" scenario to work on more profitable contexts, the most important of which are proof assistants .","title":"Type theory as an alternative"},{"location":"posts/2024/perfect-mathematics/#introducing-lean","text":"Proof assistants are a marvelous, time-saving invention, they are basically programming languages in which you write the proof of your theorem, and it spits out whether it's correct or not, using type theory for the duty.

They appeared quite a while ago, one of the most popular, Coq (yes, that's its name, I won't argue it's quite funny), was first released back in 1989, but it is mainly because of the apparition of Lean that they are experiencing a renaissance. The latter, at least for my inexperienced taste, is far more elegant than the former, here is an example from the Natural Number Game about the associativity of the natural numbers, in my opinion, the best online resource for learning this tool: theorem mul_assoc ( a b c : \u2115 ) : ( a * b ) * c = a * ( b * c ) := by induction c with k h\u2096 repeat rw [ mul_zero ] repeat rw [ mul_zero ] rfl rw [ mul_succ , mul_succ , mul_add , h\u2096 ] rfl You do not need to fully understand the proof, but simply notice the built-in induction statement, the easy support for Unicode characters, and, if you use Visual Studio Code, the amazing error spotting it provides.

Jul 5, 2025 This article served as the script for my SoME 4 submission , and it was written in collaboration with Tatiana Elokhin; a Spanish version is also available here . Let's get straight to the point: consider a circle of radius one, and, using only a ruler and a compass, I want you to construct a square of the same area. Make sure to try as hard as you can... Done? Well, whatever you've done is wrong , and it's because this was a trick question -- as you may have inferred from the title --, since I've just presented you with the millenary and impossible problem of \"squaring the circle\"; this article is precisely about it because, as we'll see, it manages to distill a great extent of the history of mathematics within its statement. The dawn of mathematics Have you ever wondered where numbers come from? I don't mean the metaphysical question of the origin of ideas, of whether theorems are invented or discovered, but something rather more tangible as the history of this discipline. Where does math as a science come from? Precisely from trying to quantify certain aspects of the daily and commercial life (it suffices to see that geometry literally meant \"land measurement\"); it's quite convenient to know that one owns exactly \\(124.25\\mathrm{m}^2\\) of land in which to plant crops, or that if you have sold 12 bottles of oil at 5 coins each, you've made a total of 60 coins. Thus, primordial mathematics had an entirely pragmatic purpose. This is reflected in the fact that the earliest cultures had formulas or \"recipes\" they simply followed without caring for an actual proof; for example, the Babylonians estimated the area of a circle as \\(3r^2\\), which officially makes them the first engineers in history (even though they didn't find that \\(e=\\sqrt{g}\\)). Nonetheless, it was the Greek civilization that provoked a paradigm change (to a great extent, thanks to Thales of Miletus); the cult of reason that was cultivated in the Hellenic region meant rejecting those mechanical procedures built upon sole evidence, and thus the sought for flawless proofs. Think now of all the mathematical knowledge as some sort of tree, where each leaf is a result that depends on many others; if we keep going further down, we'll eventually reach its roots. Because from nothing, nothing comes, some truths will have to be assumed, and for today's main characters those were the ever-so-simple line and circle , that's why rigorous classic mathematics is confined solely to constructions with ruler and compass, and that's also why the problem of today turns out to be impossible. Squaring the circle You know what the ancient Greeks were very good at? Proportion. If you gave them two distinct figures, and they could -- using their beloved ruler and compass -- turn them into squares, you can bet they would flawlessly compare their two areas. Now, which figures can be reduced to squares through the aforementioned method? Evidently triangles, and since we can divide any polygon into triangles, any polygon can be transformed into a square employing a ruler and a compass. What if the area is curved? That's not certain at all. Hippocrates shed some light on the matter and gave hope to mathematicians when he squared a lune, but something as fundamental as the circle itself -- recall that it was one of the two basic shapes -- was really getting to them. Thus, squaring the circle became the classic problem par excellence, along with trisecting an angle and doubling a cube, since it being solved would imply measuring with utter precision the area of the most important shape. Can a circle be transformed into a square of equal area using only a ruler and a compass? It's important to mention that we told a white lie above; Greek rulers weren't as fancy as those we use today either (they didn't have marks indicating certain lengths), but they were more like a straight edge, only useful to trace lines. Let's see now the tools ancient geometers had in their arsenal when dealing with operations: Firstly, if they had two segments of lengths \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), they could join them and produce one measuring their sum: \\begin{tikzpicture} \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt, white] at (0, 0) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt, white] at (2.5, 0) {}; \\draw[color=white] (0, 0) -- (2.5, 0); \\node[color=white] at (1.25, 0.25) {$a$}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt, white] at (4, 0) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt, white] at (5, 0) {}; \\draw[color=white] (4, 0) -- (5, 0); \\node[color=white] at (4.5, 0.25) {$b$}; \\draw[-Stealth, color=white] (6.5, 0) -- (7.5, 0); \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt, color=red] at (9, 0) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt, color=red] at (11.5, 0) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt, color=red] at (12.5, 0) {}; \\draw[color=red] (9, 0) -- (12.5, 0); \\node[color=red] at (10.75, 0.25) {$a+b$}; \\end{tikzpicture} Likewise, if we put the smaller segment at the end of the larger, we can find their difference: \\begin{tikzpicture} \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt, white] at (0, 0) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt, white] at (2.5, 0) {}; \\draw[color=white] (0, 0) -- (2.5, 0); \\node[color=white] at (1.25, 0.25) {$a$}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt, white] at (4, 0) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt, white] at (5, 0) {}; \\draw[color=white] (4, 0) -- (5, 0); \\node[color=white] at (4.5, 0.25) {$b$}; \\draw[-Stealth, color=white] (6.5, 0) -- (7.5, 0); \\draw[color=red] (9, 0) -- (10.5, 0); \\draw[color=white] (10.5, 0) -- (11.5, 0); \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt, color=red] at (9, 0) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt, color=red] at (10.5, 0) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt, white] at (11.5, 0) {}; \\node[color=red] at (9.75, 0.25) {$a-b$}; \\end{tikzpicture} Using triangle congruences, we can also construct the product of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\): \\begin{tikzpicture} \\draw[white] (0, 0) -- (1, 0); \\draw[white] (1, 0) -- (1, 1.5); % \\draw (0, 0) -- (1, 1.5); \\draw[white] (1, 0) -- (2, 0); \\draw[white] (2, 0) -- (2, 3); \\draw[red] (0, 0) -- (2, 3); \\node[color=red] at (1, 2) {$ab$}; \\node[white] at (0.25, 0.75) {$a$}; \\node[white] at (0.65, 0.25) {1}; \\node[white] at (1, -0.25) {$b$}; \\end{tikzpicture} And, analogously, the quotient \\(a\\) over \\(b\\): \\begin{tikzpicture} \\draw[color=white] (0, 0) -- (1, 0); \\draw[color=white] (1, 0) -- (1, 1.5); \\draw[red] (0, 0) -- (1, 1.5); \\draw[color=white] (1, 0) -- (2, 0); \\draw[color=white] (2, 0) -- (2, 3); \\draw[color=white] (1, 1.5) -- (2, 3); \\node[color=white] at (1, 2) {$a$}; \\node[color=red] at (0, 0.75) {$a / b$}; \\node[color=white] at (0.65, 0.25) {1}; \\node[color=white] at (1, -0.25) {$b$}; \\end{tikzpicture} Finally, by making a circumference of diameter \\(a+1\\) we can find \\(\\sqrt a\\): \\begin{tikzpicture} \\draw[color=white] (0, 0) -- (4, 0); \\draw[color=white] (4, 0) -- (5, 0); \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt, color=white] at (0, 0) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt, color=red] at (4, 0) {}; \\node[color=white] at (2, 0.25) {$a$}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt, color=white] at (5, 0) {}; \\node[color=white] at (4.5, 0.25) {1}; \\draw[color=white] (5, 0) arc (0:180:2.5); \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt, color=red] at (4, 2) {}; \\draw[color=red] (4, 0) -- (4, 2); \\node[color=red] at (3.5, 1) {$\\sqrt{a}$}; \\end{tikzpicture} Greek arithmetic was thus reduced to these scarce operations, and all numbers that could be obtained from them are called constructible , because they can indeed be constructed with ruler and compass. Let's go back to our problem, and consider the case when the radius is one (any other is equivalent after scaling down and then rescaling the final solution), that would mean that in order to square that circle we would need a square of side \\(\\sqrt\\pi\\), but since we have no problem at all in taking square roots, squaring the circle is possible if and only if \\(\\pi\\) is a constructible number. Can \\(\\pi\\) be expressed as a combination of sums, subtractions, products, divisions, and square roots applied to integer numbers? Thus, we have converted an entirely geometric scenario into an algebraic one, which would have to wait millennia to finally be solved. The solution Jumping straight into a proof would not only be unsatisfactory, but also disrespectful towards the arduous work of the mathematical community through that period; it would obviate, as we've already said, a couple millennia of history. Not for anything did it become the obsession of uncountable mathematicians, from hobbyists to professionals, some of which to this day keep sending wrong constructions to universities all across the world. It is such the popularity of this problem that is has become a synonym for impossibility and made its way into the pop culture to appear in news, songs, books and even in Dante's Divine Comedy : What is the geometrician who fixes himself entirely on measuring the circle, and does not find, by thinking, that principle from which he needs,[...] The most important discoveries in this field set off with Archimedes' study of the circle and his estimation of the number \\(\\pi\\), but it was undoubtedly the introduction of the coordinate plane by Ren\u00e9 Descartes the most important insight towards the final solution, because through him mathematicians could then describe geometric figures as algebraic equations. The final bit was authored by Ferdinand von Lindemann, who actually proved a stronger claim. An algebraic number is one that can be written as the solution of a polynomial equation with integer coefficients; notice that every constructible number is also algebraic, so if it isn't algebraic, it won't be constructible either. What Lindemann really proved was that if a given \\(\\alpha\\) is algebraic, then \\(e^\\alpha\\) isn't, and thus our problem falls as a corollary: A circle can't be squared using only ruler and compass. Let's suppose the circle can be squared, and thus \\(\\pi\\) is constructible and algebraic. The imaginary unit is too, since it is a solution to \\(x^2 + 1 = 0\\), then evidently \\(i\\pi\\) is algebraic as well. Therefore, by Lindemann's theorem, \\(e^{i\\pi} = -1\\) shouldn't be, but this is a contradiction because \\(-1\\) is clearly algebraic, hence our assumption was wrong and \\(\\pi\\) is neither algebraic nor constructible. Numbers that are not algebraic are called transcendental , a name which encapsulates the importance of this problem for the history of this discipline. After all, the enigma that drove mathematicians crazy turned out to be impossible. How to actually square the circle But remember once again the rules of this game, ruler and compass. If we relax them and allow other utensils and procedures, then of course, one can square the circle. To sum up, here's one of such constructions: We start from a circle of radius \\(r\\), thus area \\(\\pi r^2\\). Let's roll it in such a way that its circumference (\\(2\\pi r\\)) is now a segment, which we'll divide in half and add \\(r\\) afterwards to form the diameter of a semicircle, on which we'll trace a height \\(h\\) in the point connecting \\(\\pi r\\) and \\(r\\) and then form three right triangles: \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.2073] \\draw[color=white] (0, 0) -- (3.1416, 0); \\draw[color=white] (3.1416, 0) -- (4.1416, 0); \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt] at (0, 0) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt, color=red] at (3.1416, 0) {}; \\node[color=white] at (1.5708, 0.25) {$\\pi r$}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt] at (4.1416, 0) {}; \\node[color=white] at (3.6416, 0.25) {$r$}; \\draw[color=white] (4.1416, 0) arc (0:180:2.0708); \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt, color=red] at (3.1416, 1.7725) {}; \\draw[color=red] (3.1416, 0) -- (3.1416, 1.7724); \\node[color=red] at (2.6416, 0.8862) {$h$}; \\draw[dashed,color=white] (0, 0) -- (3.1416, 1.7724); \\draw[dashed,color=white] (3.1416, 1.7724) -- (4.1416, 0); \\node[fill=white] at (1.5708, 0.9) {$a$}; \\node[fill=white] at (3.5316, 0.8862) {$b$}; \\end{tikzpicture} From here follow the three equations below: \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{cases} a^2 &= (\\pi r)^2 + h^2\\\\ b^2 &= r^2 + h^2\\\\ (\\pi r + r)^2 &= a^2 + b^2 \\end{cases} &\\implies (\\pi r + r)^2 = (\\pi r)^2 + r^2 + 2h^2 \\implies 2h^2 = 2\\pi r^2\\\\ &\\implies \\boxed{h = \\sqrt{\\pi} r.} \\end{align*}\\] And with this, ladies and gentlemen, we've constructed the longitude we were looking for, and creating a square with this segment as side won't be but the cherry on top of a cake mathematics could never taste. \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.2073] \\draw[color=white] (0, 0) -- (3.1416, 0); \\draw[color=white] (3.1416, 0) -- (4.1416, 0); \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt, color=white] at (0, 0) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt, color=red] at (3.1416, 0) {}; \\node[color=white] at (1.5708, 0.25) {$\\pi r$}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt, color=white] at (4.1416, 0) {}; \\node[color=white] at (3.6416, 0.25) {$r$}; \\draw[color=white] (4.1416, 0) arc (0:180:2.0708); \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt, color=red] at (3.1416, 1.7725) {}; \\draw[color=red] (3.1416, 0) rectangle (3.1416+1.7724,1.7724); % \\draw[color=red] (3.1416, 0) -- (3.1416, 1.7724); \\node[color=red] at (2.6416, 0.8862) {$\\sqrt{\\pi} r$}; \\end{tikzpicture} References \u00bfQui\u00e9n dijo que la cuadratura del c\u00edrculo era imposible?

I don't mean the metaphysical question of the origin of ideas, of whether theorems are invented or discovered, but something rather more tangible as the history of this discipline. Where does math as a science come from? Precisely from trying to quantify certain aspects of the daily and commercial life (it suffices to see that geometry literally meant \"land measurement\"); it's quite convenient to know that one owns exactly \\(124.25\\mathrm{m}^2\\) of land in which to plant crops, or that if you have sold 12 bottles of oil at 5 coins each, you've made a total of 60 coins. Thus, primordial mathematics had an entirely pragmatic purpose. This is reflected in the fact that the earliest cultures had formulas or \"recipes\" they simply followed without caring for an actual proof; for example, the Babylonians estimated the area of a circle as \\(3r^2\\), which officially makes them the first engineers in history (even though they didn't find that \\(e=\\sqrt{g}\\)). Nonetheless, it was the Greek civilization that provoked a paradigm change (to a great extent, thanks to Thales of Miletus); the cult of reason that was cultivated in the Hellenic region meant rejecting those mechanical procedures built upon sole evidence, and thus the sought for flawless proofs. Think now of all the mathematical knowledge as some sort of tree, where each leaf is a result that depends on many others; if we keep going further down, we'll eventually reach its roots. Because from nothing, nothing comes, some truths will have to be assumed, and for today's main characters those were the ever-so-simple line and circle , that's why rigorous classic mathematics is confined solely to constructions with ruler and compass, and that's also why the problem of today turns out to be impossible.","title":"The dawn of mathematics"},{"location":"posts/2025/squaring-the-circle/#squaring-the-circle","text":"You know what the ancient Greeks were very good at? Proportion. If you gave them two distinct figures, and they could -- using their beloved ruler and compass -- turn them into squares, you can bet they would flawlessly compare their two areas. Now, which figures can be reduced to squares through the aforementioned method? Evidently triangles, and since we can divide any polygon into triangles, any polygon can be transformed into a square employing a ruler and a compass. What if the area is curved? That's not certain at all. Hippocrates shed some light on the matter and gave hope to mathematicians when he squared a lune, but something as fundamental as the circle itself -- recall that it was one of the two basic shapes -- was really getting to them. Thus, squaring the circle became the classic problem par excellence, along with trisecting an angle and doubling a cube, since it being solved would imply measuring with utter precision the area of the most important shape. Can a circle be transformed into a square of equal area using only a ruler and a compass?

Let's roll it in such a way that its circumference (\\(2\\pi r\\)) is now a segment, which we'll divide in half and add \\(r\\) afterwards to form the diameter of a semicircle, on which we'll trace a height \\(h\\) in the point connecting \\(\\pi r\\) and \\(r\\) and then form three right triangles: \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.2073] \\draw[color=white] (0, 0) -- (3.1416, 0); \\draw[color=white] (3.1416, 0) -- (4.1416, 0); \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt] at (0, 0) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt, color=red] at (3.1416, 0) {}; \\node[color=white] at (1.5708, 0.25) {$\\pi r$}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt] at (4.1416, 0) {}; \\node[color=white] at (3.6416, 0.25) {$r$}; \\draw[color=white] (4.1416, 0) arc (0:180:2.0708); \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt, color=red] at (3.1416, 1.7725) {}; \\draw[color=red] (3.1416, 0) -- (3.1416, 1.7724); \\node[color=red] at (2.6416, 0.8862) {$h$}; \\draw[dashed,color=white] (0, 0) -- (3.1416, 1.7724); \\draw[dashed,color=white] (3.1416, 1.7724) -- (4.1416, 0); \\node[fill=white] at (1.5708, 0.9) {$a$}; \\node[fill=white] at (3.5316, 0.8862) {$b$}; \\end{tikzpicture} From here follow the three equations below: \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{cases} a^2 &= (\\pi r)^2 + h^2\\\\ b^2 &= r^2 + h^2\\\\ (\\pi r + r)^2 &= a^2 + b^2 \\end{cases} &\\implies (\\pi r + r)^2 = (\\pi r)^2 + r^2 + 2h^2 \\implies 2h^2 = 2\\pi r^2\\\\ &\\implies \\boxed{h = \\sqrt{\\pi} r.} \\end{align*}\\] And with this, ladies and gentlemen, we've constructed the longitude we were looking for, and creating a square with this segment as side won't be but the cherry on top of a cake mathematics could never taste. \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.2073] \\draw[color=white] (0, 0) -- (3.1416, 0); \\draw[color=white] (3.1416, 0) -- (4.1416, 0); \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt, color=white] at (0, 0) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt, color=red] at (3.1416, 0) {}; \\node[color=white] at (1.5708, 0.25) {$\\pi r$}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt, color=white] at (4.1416, 0) {}; \\node[color=white] at (3.6416, 0.25) {$r$}; \\draw[color=white] (4.1416, 0) arc (0:180:2.0708); \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1pt, color=red] at (3.1416, 1.7725) {}; \\draw[color=red] (3.1416, 0) rectangle (3.1416+1.7724,1.7724); % \\draw[color=red] (3.1416, 0) -- (3.1416, 1.7724); \\node[color=red] at (2.6416, 0.8862) {$\\sqrt{\\pi} r$}; \\end{tikzpicture}","title":"How to actually square the circle"},{"location":"posts/2025/squaring-the-circle/#references","text":"\u00bfQui\u00e9n dijo que la cuadratura del c\u00edrculo era imposible?
