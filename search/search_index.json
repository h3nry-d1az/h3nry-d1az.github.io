It probably owes its popularity to its early discovery by the sculptor Phidias back in Ancient Greece, or to the fact that it emerges from the study of something as natural as proportions are, and it could even be a cause of its manifold, beautiful representations and its unexpected apparitions in nature. Nonetheless, and despite its major transcendence, it is a concept even a child could fathom, and with a relatively straightforward definition: Mathematically correct definition In order to determine the golden ratio, we must first understand what a golden proportion is per se: It is said that two lengths are in golden proportion if the ratio between the two combined and the longest equals the ratio between the longest and the shortest. That is, if \\(a > b\\), then \\(\\frac{a+b}{a} = \\frac{a}{b}\\). If you've just gotten dizzy, let me tell you not to worry, because at first glance this statement may seem sort of abstract -- since we have not defined an actual constant, but rather a relationship that can be satisfied by infinite numbers --. Furthermore, it's phrased in more rigorous mathematical terminology, which hides its beautiful geometric intuition; so, to solve these two problems, let's start again and define this concept one more time. Geometric definition Suppose we have two differently-sized rods, which we'll call \\(a\\) to the longest and \\(b\\) to the shortest. Let's now put them together, yielding a new one with length \\(a+b\\), just like it is shown below: \\begin{tikzpicture} \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=red] (AB_1) at (-2, 0) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=red] (AB_2) at (-2, -1.62) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=blue] (AB_3) at (-2, -2.62) {}; \\draw[color = red] (AB_1) -- (AB_2); \\draw[color = blue] (AB_2) -- (AB_3); \\node at (-1.75, -0.90) {$a$}; \\node at (-1.75, -1.73) {$b$}; \\node at (-1.75, -1.31) {$+$}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=red] (A_1) at (0, -0.5) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=red] (A_2) at (0, -2.12) {}; \\draw[red] (A_1) -- (A_2); \\node at (0.25, -1.31) {$a$}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=blue] (B_1) at (2, -0.81) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=blue] (B_2) at (2, -1.81) {}; \\draw[blue] (B_1) -- (B_2); \\node at (2.25, -1.31) {$b$}; \\end{tikzpicture} Notice an interesting property of the previous image, namely that comparing the newly-constructed stick \\(a+b\\) with \\(a\\) is like measuring \\(a\\) against \\(b\\), but in a reduced scale. They are in the same proportion! Now, it is true that I have selected this detail deliberately, and not all bars satisfy this property, so we'll say that the \\(a,b\\) that do verify it are in golden proportion . This is the true motivation behind the earlier definition. It now makes way more sense, doesn't it? But, as we mentioned in the beginning, the golden ratio is a constant , not an infinite group of numbers that meet a property, and its magnitude is precisely the earlier quotient of both lengths. We've now got all the tools we need to find its exact value: All the numbers in golden proportion have as ratio \\(\\frac{1+\\sqrt5}{2}\\). As we stated above, this value is commonly represented as \\(\\varphi\\) in honor of the aforementioned Phidias, and I won't be making an exception here. Replacing then \\(\\varphi\\) for \\(a/b\\) in the first definition and simplifying we reach the following equality: $$ \\begin{align*} \\frac{a}{b}&=\\frac{a+b}{a}\\implies\\frac{a}{b}=1+\\frac{b}{a}\\\\ &\\implies \\varphi = 1 + \\varphi^{-1}\\\\ &\\implies \\varphi^2 = \\varphi + 1\\\\ &\\implies \\varphi^2 - \\varphi - 1 = 0 \\end{align*} $$ Which is a classic quadratic equation that any high school student could solve, so it will suffice to employ Bhaskara's formula: $$ \\begin{align*} \\varphi &= \\frac{-(-1)\\pm\\sqrt{(-1)^2-4\\cdot(1)\\cdot(-1)}}{2\\cdot(1)} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\end{align*} $$ Nevertheless, \\(\\varphi\\) must be positive, since we are dealing with a ratio of positive numbers, therefore we can discard the second solution: $$\\varphi = \\frac{1+\\sqrt5}{2}$$ The other remaining value is called the conjugate of \\(\\varphi\\), because it has the sign of the second summand inverted. It is usually denoted by \\(\\tilde\\varphi\\) and, in a enthralling manner, it holds that \\(\\tilde\\varphi = -\\frac{1}{\\varphi} = 1-\\varphi\\). To conclude this section, below are listed a hundred significant figures of this curious constant: 1. 6 1 8 0339887 4989484820 4586834365 6381177203 0917980576 2862135448 6227052604 6281890244 9707207204 1893911374\u2026 The metallic numbers But, why stop here? Sure the golden ratio is such an interesting concept, but will it be the only value with similar characteristics? The solution to this unknown are the \"metallic numbers\", whose structure we'll study next, and whose name alludes to the gold in golden ratio . The golden ratio, revisited Recall the geometric definition for a golden proportion we came up with, and let's put the rods \\(a+b\\) and \\(a\\) perpendicularly, forming a rectangle like the following: \\begin{tikzpicture} \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=red] (A_1) at (0, 0) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=red] (A_2) at (0, -2) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=red] (AB_1) at (2, -2) {}; \\node (AB_null) at (2, 0) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=blue] (AB_2) at (3.24, -2) {}; \\node (AB_2_null) at (3.24, 0) {}; \\draw[color = red, fill=red!35] (A_1.center) -- (A_2.center) -- (AB_1.center) -- (AB_null.center) -- cycle; \\draw[color = blue, fill=blue!35] (AB_1.center) -- (AB_2.center) -- (AB_2_null.center) -- (AB_null.center) -- cycle; \\node at (1, -2.39) {$a$}; \\node at (2.62, -2.35) {$b$}; \\node at (2, -2.35) {$+$}; \\node at (-0.35, -1) {$a$}; \\end{tikzpicture} Let's now detach the blue rectangle from the former and see what happens: \\begin{tikzpicture} \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=red] (A_1) at (0, 0) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=red] (A_2) at (0, -2) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=red] (AB_1) at (2, -2) {}; \\node (AB_null) at (2, 0) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=blue] (AB_2) at (3.24, -2) {}; \\node (AB_2_null) at (3.24, 0) {}; \\draw[color = red, fill=red!35] (A_1.center) -- (A_2.center) -- (AB_1.center) -- (AB_null.center) -- cycle; \\draw[color = blue, fill=blue!35] (AB_1.center) -- (AB_2.center) -- (AB_2_null.center) -- (AB_null.center) -- cycle; \\node at (1, -2.39) {$a$}; \\node at (2.62, -2.35) {$b$}; \\node at (2, -2.35) {$+$}; \\node at (-0.35, -1) {$a$}; \\node at (4.24, -1) {$\\longrightarrow$}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=blue] (B_1) at (5.59, -0.38) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=blue] (B_2) at (5.59, -1.62) {}; \\node (B_4) at (7.59, -0.38) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=blue] (B_3) at (7.59, -1.62) {}; \\draw[color = blue, fill=blue!35] (B_1.center) -- (B_2.center) -- (B_3.center) -- (B_4.center) -- cycle; \\node at (5.24, -1) {$b$}; \\node at (6.59, -1.97) {$a$}; \\end{tikzpicture} Like the lengths from our old definition, the new rectangle is equal to the previous one, but deescalated; that is, they are both proportional to one another. This new property is equivalent to the earlier definition and, perhaps, even more visual. Furthermore, it'll be our starting point to generalize the golden ratio. Just as a curiosity, the DIN A x paper formats are based upon a similar idea, but in that case, the proportion is \\(\\sqrt2\\), because cutting in half a DIN A3 produces two DIN A4, a DIN A4 two DIN A5, and so forth. Can you show why this is the ratio? (Hint: use the proof for the theorem we have just discussed.) Definition of the metallic numbers Allow me to go back to the previous rectangle and tweak it slightly. What if I wanted a rectangle with this same property, but more stretched? At first glance, one may wonder: \u201cWhy would I want something like this?\u201d but this shape would have numerous applications, combining the robustness of the former with dimensions more suitable for certain situations. By our previous theorem, something exactly equal is impossible, yet we can apply a little trick to obtain what we're looking for: \\begin{tikzpicture} \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=red] (A_1) at (0, 0) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=red] (A_2) at (0, -2.41) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=red] (AB_1) at (4.82, -2.41) {}; \\node (AB_null) at (4.82, 0) {}; \\node[circle,fill, inner sep=1.5pt, color=blue] (AB_2) at (5.82, -2.41) {}; \\node (AB_2_null) at (5.82, 0) {}; \\draw[color = red, fill=red!35] (A_1.center) -- (A_2.center) -- (AB_1.center) -- (AB_null.center) -- cycle; \\draw[color = blue, fill=blue!35] (AB_1.center) -- (AB_2.center) -- (AB_2_null.center) -- (AB_null.center) -- cycle; \\node at (2.41, -2.76) {$2a$}; \\node at (5.32, -2.76) {$b$}; \\node at (4.82, -2.76) {$+$}; \\node at (-0.35, -1.205) {$a$}; \\end{tikzpicture} Multiplying the \\(a\\) of the longer segment by a constant yields something along those lines. And the number two here isn't special at all, it could very well be a 3, a 4, or generalizing , any given \\(n\\)! However, we stumble upon a small problem, being that varying the longitude of the segments changes our proportion too, so the golden ratio would take a new value in this case, although it would receive the name of golden ratio , but rather we shall call it a metallic number . In general, the metallic number resulting from multiplying \\(a\\) by \\(n\\) will be called the nth metallic number. Finding the nth metallic number Before proceeding with the computations, let's introduce some notation to summarize with more precision and rigor the geometric concept we've been developing until now: The nth metallic number, denoted \\(\\mu_n\\), is defined as the quotient \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\), where the values \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) verify the following relationship: $$\\frac{a}{b}=\\frac{na+b}{a}$$ I've chosen the Greek letter \\(\\mu_n\\) to represent this collection, since metal in Ancient Greek is \u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd, and these were the discoverers of this idea; although it is worth pointing out that it can be seen represented as \\(A(n)\\), and virtually as other variations of which I'm unaware. Regardless, armed with the previous definition and the proof of the first theorem, we can once and for all find a general expression for \\(\\mu_n\\): The nth metallic number has as value $$\\mu_n = \\frac{n+\\sqrt{n^2+4}}{2}.$$ Recalling the definition of a metallic number, we have that: $$ \\begin{align*} \\frac{a}{b}&=\\frac{na+b}{a}\\implies\\frac{a}{b}=n+\\frac{b}{a}\\\\ &\\implies \\mu_n = n + {\\mu_n}^{-1}\\\\ &\\implies {\\mu_n}^2 = n{\\mu_n} + 1\\\\ &\\implies {\\mu_n}^2 - n{\\mu_n} - 1 = 0 \\end{align*} $$ Which is yet another quadratic equation with an easy solution: $$ \\begin{align*} \\mu_n &= \\frac{-(-n)\\pm\\sqrt{(-n)^2-4\\cdot(1)\\cdot(-1)}}{2\\cdot(1)}\\\\ &= \\frac{n\\pm\\sqrt{n^2+4}}{2} \\end{align*} $$ And since all \\(\\mu_n\\) have to be greater than zero -- because they denote the ratio of two positive quantities --, we can discard with no fear the negative roots: $$\\mu_n = \\frac{n+\\sqrt{n^2+4}}{2}$$ As it was to be proven. The first five metallic numbers already have a name (and even symbol), being the following : .tg {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;} .tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px; overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;11 font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg .tg-axxb{background-color:#c0c0c0;border-color:inherit;color:#000000;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-c3ow{border-color:inherit;text-align:center;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-2yfi{background-color:#c0c0c0;border-color:inherit;color:#000000;text-align:center;vertical-align:top} \\(n\\) Metal Symbol Exact value Approximated value 1 Gold \\(\\varphi\\) \\(\\frac{1+\\sqrt5}{2}\\) 1.618033989\u2026 2 Silver \\(\\delta_S\\) \\(1+\\sqrt2\\) 2.414213562\u2026 3 Bronze \\(\\delta_{\\text{Br}}\\) \\(\\frac{3+\\sqrt{13}}{2}\\) 3.302775638\u2026 4 Copper \\(\\delta_{\\text{Cu}}\\) \\(2+\\sqrt5\\) 4.236067978\u2026 5 Nickel \\(\\delta_{\\text{Ni}}\\) \\(\\frac{5+\\sqrt{29}}{2}\\) 5.192582404\u2026 Nonetheless, the remaining infinite ones have neither an official, recognized nickname, nor an associated symbol, so I can take for example \\(\\mu_{14}=7+5\\sqrt{2}\\), and hereby name it Henry's number , giving it the symbol \\(\\mathfrak h\\). And, of course, you can do this same thing as well. Abstraction in mathematics There's a quote from the great mathematician J. Henri Poincar\u00e9 which, from my perspective, brings together exceptionally the main idea of this essay: \"Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things.\" And it is true that the spirit of a mathematician isn't fulfilled with discovering an interesting property, but craves to explore the limits of their finding, thus expanding it in such a way that what was earlier thought as a whole, now it isn't but a special case of a more robust theory, which englobes entities formerly unrelated but now connected. This process receives the name of abstraction or generalization and, although in principle can appear confusing and useless, it is one of the more powerful tools mathematicians have at their disposal and, more importantly, the fire that fuels their work.","title":"The Golden Ratio and the Metallic Numbers"},{"location":"posts/2024/golden-ratio-and-metallic-numbers/#the-golden-ratio-and-the-metallic-numbers","text":"Oct 10, 2024","title":"The Golden Ratio and the Metallic Numbers"},{"location":"posts/2024/golden-ratio-and-metallic-numbers/#the-golden-ratio","text":"The golden number, also called the golden ratio or simply phi (\\(\\varphi\\)) -- and sometimes even God's number -- is probably one of the most famous math constants of all time.

They are in the same proportion! Now, it is true that I have selected this detail deliberately, and not all bars satisfy this property, so we'll say that the \\(a,b\\) that do verify it are in golden proportion . This is the true motivation behind the earlier definition. It now makes way more sense, doesn't it? But, as we mentioned in the beginning, the golden ratio is a constant , not an infinite group of numbers that meet a property, and its magnitude is precisely the earlier quotient of both lengths. We've now got all the tools we need to find its exact value: All the numbers in golden proportion have as ratio \\(\\frac{1+\\sqrt5}{2}\\). As we stated above, this value is commonly represented as \\(\\varphi\\) in honor of the aforementioned Phidias, and I won't be making an exception here. Replacing then \\(\\varphi\\) for \\(a/b\\) in the first definition and simplifying we reach the following equality: $$ \\begin{align*} \\frac{a}{b}&=\\frac{a+b}{a}\\implies\\frac{a}{b}=1+\\frac{b}{a}\\\\ &\\implies \\varphi = 1 + \\varphi^{-1}\\\\ &\\implies \\varphi^2 = \\varphi + 1\\\\ &\\implies \\varphi^2 - \\varphi - 1 = 0 \\end{align*} $$ Which is a classic quadratic equation that any high school student could solve, so it will suffice to employ Bhaskara's formula: $$ \\begin{align*} \\varphi &= \\frac{-(-1)\\pm\\sqrt{(-1)^2-4\\cdot(1)\\cdot(-1)}}{2\\cdot(1)} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\end{align*} $$ Nevertheless, \\(\\varphi\\) must be positive, since we are dealing with a ratio of positive numbers, therefore we can discard the second solution: $$\\varphi = \\frac{1+\\sqrt5}{2}$$ The other remaining value is called the conjugate of \\(\\varphi\\), because it has the sign of the second summand inverted. It is usually denoted by \\(\\tilde\\varphi\\) and, in a enthralling manner, it holds that \\(\\tilde\\varphi = -\\frac{1}{\\varphi} = 1-\\varphi\\).

Regardless, armed with the previous definition and the proof of the first theorem, we can once and for all find a general expression for \\(\\mu_n\\): The nth metallic number has as value $$\\mu_n = \\frac{n+\\sqrt{n^2+4}}{2}.$$ Recalling the definition of a metallic number, we have that: $$ \\begin{align*} \\frac{a}{b}&=\\frac{na+b}{a}\\implies\\frac{a}{b}=n+\\frac{b}{a}\\\\ &\\implies \\mu_n = n + {\\mu_n}^{-1}\\\\ &\\implies {\\mu_n}^2 = n{\\mu_n} + 1\\\\ &\\implies {\\mu_n}^2 - n{\\mu_n} - 1 = 0 \\end{align*} $$ Which is yet another quadratic equation with an easy solution: $$ \\begin{align*} \\mu_n &= \\frac{-(-n)\\pm\\sqrt{(-n)^2-4\\cdot(1)\\cdot(-1)}}{2\\cdot(1)}\\\\ &= \\frac{n\\pm\\sqrt{n^2+4}}{2} \\end{align*} $$ And since all \\(\\mu_n\\) have to be greater than zero -- because they denote the ratio of two positive quantities --, we can discard with no fear the negative roots: $$\\mu_n = \\frac{n+\\sqrt{n^2+4}}{2}$$ As it was to be proven.

The story behind type theory To understand why type theory even exists, we need to go back to the late 1800s and early 1900s when the attempt to find those \"building blocks\" of mathematics was at its peak. By then, a mathematician named Gottlob Frege proposed his own theory, which rapidly became very popular, until another mathematician, with name Bertrand Russell, found a flaw in Frege's axioms, the infamous Russell's paradox . One of Frege's assumptions was that, given any (formal) statement, there existed a set containing all the sets that met it, so Russell said -- and here I paraphrase -- : \"Oh yeah? So what about the property: '\\(x \\notin x\\)' (\\(x\\) is not in \\(x\\))?\" Which completely obliterated Frege's work. Let's think about why: For the rest of the sets, there should be no problem, either they satisfy the property or they don't, but it shouldn't be a big deal. For the big, container set, however, we have two options: The big set contains itself, and thus by our assumption the big set is not included in the big set. The big set doesn't contain itself, and thus by our assumption the big set is included in itself. One can see then that the former case leads to the latter, and the latter to the former in an infinite loop that is nothing but a HUGE contradiction. This clearly had to be fixed, so mathematicians back in the day began working on the issue. The year is 1908, and two landmark papers are published. First, Zermelo's famous proposal, but Russell had his own idea two, what nowadays is known as type theory , and now, in the XXI century is achieving its prime popularity. Type theory as an alternative If you have ever coded in a statically typed language, you sort of know what this business is all about. We have elements, namely \\(a, b, x, y, \\ldots\\), -- which correspond to variables -- that can belong to a collection named type . We denote this ownership by $$x: \\mathtt{type},$$ just like you would in Rust or TypeScript. Note that functions are still a thing, so for example, $$f: \\mathtt{t}_1 \\rightarrow \\mathtt{t}_2$$ is an object that takes an input from a type \\(\\mathtt{t}_1\\) and returns another from a type \\(\\mathtt{t}_2\\). Furthermore, \\(\\mathtt{t}_1 \\rightarrow \\mathtt{t}_2\\) is a type as well, and so is \\(\\mathtt{t}_1 \\times \\mathtt{t}_2\\), and so forth. With all this, type theory becomes a very robust framework, and the magic comes when we stop thinking of types as sets , and start thinking of them as propositions . Then, a member of the type will be a proof of the proposition, and the compound types \\(\\mathtt{t}_1 \\rightarrow \\mathtt{t}_2\\) and \\(\\mathtt{t}_1 \\times \\mathtt{t}_2\\) represent implication and conjunction respectively. It is because of this comfortable correspondence with logic that type theory has been brought out of the \"building blocks\" scenario to work on more profitable contexts, the most important of which are proof assistants . Introducing Lean Proof assistants are a marvelous, time-saving invention, they are basically programming languages in which you write the proof of your theorem, and it spits out whether it's correct or not, using type theory for the duty. It's like having a [very pedantic] little fella next to you all the time, that ensures -- with a mathematically proven reliability -- that you are making no mistakes. They appeared quite a while ago, one of the most popular, Coq (yes, that's its name, I won't argue it's quite funny), was first released back in 1989, but it is mainly because of the apparition of Lean that they are experiencing a renaissance. The latter, at least for my inexperienced taste, is far more elegant than the former, here is an example from the Natural Number Game about the associativity of the natural numbers, in my opinion, the best online resource for learning this tool: theorem mul_assoc ( a b c : \u2115 ) : ( a * b ) * c = a * ( b * c ) := by induction c with k h\u2096 repeat rw [ mul_zero ] repeat rw [ mul_zero ] rfl rw [ mul_succ , mul_succ , mul_add , h\u2096 ] rfl You do not need to fully understand the proof, but simply notice the built-in induction statement, the easy support for Unicode characters, and, if you use Visual Studio Code, the amazing error spotting it provides. It may seem a hard tool to master at first glance, and indeed it is not easy, but surely it is not a waste of time either. \u201cPerfect\u201d Mathematics This begs the question: \"Can we ensure our mathematics are flawless using proof assistants?\" The answer is sadly no because of G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems, but what we can do is to prove that, provided our assumptions, our proofs are valid, and there's a devoted collective out there trying to accomplish this dream. The proofs already exist, we just need to formalize them!

By then, a mathematician named Gottlob Frege proposed his own theory, which rapidly became very popular, until another mathematician, with name Bertrand Russell, found a flaw in Frege's axioms, the infamous Russell's paradox . One of Frege's assumptions was that, given any (formal) statement, there existed a set containing all the sets that met it, so Russell said -- and here I paraphrase -- : \"Oh yeah? So what about the property: '\\(x \\notin x\\)' (\\(x\\) is not in \\(x\\))?\" Which completely obliterated Frege's work. Let's think about why: For the rest of the sets, there should be no problem, either they satisfy the property or they don't, but it shouldn't be a big deal. For the big, container set, however, we have two options: The big set contains itself, and thus by our assumption the big set is not included in the big set. The big set doesn't contain itself, and thus by our assumption the big set is included in itself. One can see then that the former case leads to the latter, and the latter to the former in an infinite loop that is nothing but a HUGE contradiction. This clearly had to be fixed, so mathematicians back in the day began working on the issue. The year is 1908, and two landmark papers are published. First, Zermelo's famous proposal, but Russell had his own idea two, what nowadays is known as type theory , and now, in the XXI century is achieving its prime popularity.","title":"The story behind type theory"},{"location":"posts/2024/perfect-mathematics/#type-theory-as-an-alternative","text":"If you have ever coded in a statically typed language, you sort of know what this business is all about. We have elements, namely \\(a, b, x, y, \\ldots\\), -- which correspond to variables -- that can belong to a collection named type . We denote this ownership by $$x: \\mathtt{type},$$ just like you would in Rust or TypeScript. Note that functions are still a thing, so for example, $$f: \\mathtt{t}_1 \\rightarrow \\mathtt{t}_2$$ is an object that takes an input from a type \\(\\mathtt{t}_1\\) and returns another from a type \\(\\mathtt{t}_2\\). Furthermore, \\(\\mathtt{t}_1 \\rightarrow \\mathtt{t}_2\\) is a type as well, and so is \\(\\mathtt{t}_1 \\times \\mathtt{t}_2\\), and so forth. With all this, type theory becomes a very robust framework, and the magic comes when we stop thinking of types as sets , and start thinking of them as propositions . Then, a member of the type will be a proof of the proposition, and the compound types \\(\\mathtt{t}_1 \\rightarrow \\mathtt{t}_2\\) and \\(\\mathtt{t}_1 \\times \\mathtt{t}_2\\) represent implication and conjunction respectively. It is because of this comfortable correspondence with logic that type theory has been brought out of the \"building blocks\" scenario to work on more profitable contexts, the most important of which are proof assistants .","title":"Type theory as an alternative"},{"location":"posts/2024/perfect-mathematics/#introducing-lean","text":"Proof assistants are a marvelous, time-saving invention, they are basically programming languages in which you write the proof of your theorem, and it spits out whether it's correct or not, using type theory for the duty. It's like having a [very pedantic] little fella next to you all the time, that ensures -- with a mathematically proven reliability -- that you are making no mistakes. They appeared quite a while ago, one of the most popular, Coq (yes, that's its name, I won't argue it's quite funny), was first released back in 1989, but it is mainly because of the apparition of Lean that they are experiencing a renaissance. The latter, at least for my inexperienced taste, is far more elegant than the former, here is an example from the Natural Number Game about the associativity of the natural numbers, in my opinion, the best online resource for learning this tool: theorem mul_assoc ( a b c : \u2115 ) : ( a * b ) * c = a * ( b * c ) := by induction c with k h\u2096 repeat rw [ mul_zero ] repeat rw [ mul_zero ] rfl rw [ mul_succ , mul_succ , mul_add , h\u2096 ] rfl You do not need to fully understand the proof, but simply notice the built-in induction statement, the easy support for Unicode characters, and, if you use Visual Studio Code, the amazing error spotting it provides. It may seem a hard tool to master at first glance, and indeed it is not easy, but surely it is not a waste of time either.","title":"Introducing Lean"},{"location":"posts/2024/perfect-mathematics/#perfect-mathematics","text":"This begs the question: \"Can we ensure our mathematics are flawless using proof assistants?\" The answer is sadly no because of G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems, but what we can do is to prove that, provided our assumptions, our proofs are valid, and there's a devoted collective out there trying to accomplish this dream. The proofs already exist, we just need to formalize them! To close off, I would like to mention a project that is being carried out by the Imperial College of London, and which I do genuinely like, which is to formalize Fermat's Last Theorem in Lean.","title":"\u201cPerfect\u201d Mathematics"}]}
