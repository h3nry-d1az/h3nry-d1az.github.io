<p>For the past couple of years, I've been an avid enthusiast of the <a href="https://www.rsme.es/category/el-problema-del-mes/">problem of the month</a> section run by the <em>Real Sociedad Matemática Española</em> (RSME), and believe it or not, it has truly given me some of the most satisfying "eureka" moments I have ever experienced in my entire life. In some way, it has brought me the motivation to do math on my own -- because being featured as a solver is a really appealing reward --, to enjoy the problem-solving experience for its own sake, and sometimes pretty much the only thing to look forward to. I can undoubtedly say that I've matured mathematically with it, and it's something I'll always be grateful for.</p>
<p>The project started aiming to keep people thinking back during the lockdown, but this present year things have gone downhill: problems have been delayed every single month, until in April the last one to date was published, with remarkably already well-known questions and a very sloppy appearance overall (notice the URL references March instead of April and the year is not present). It is such a pity -- which I suspect may be a consequence of a possible lack of funding or personnel, or even a decrease in participants -- because this section meant a lot to many people like me.</p>
<h1 id="one-of-my-favorite-problems">One of my favorite problems</h1>
<p>Today, I'd like to share by far my favorite from this year and one of my top-3 ever by far. It corresponds to the senior one in the <a href="https://www.rsme.es/2025/02/el-problema-del-mes-febrero-2025/">February issue</a>, and I like it because it's short but clever, looks nasty and intimidating but rapidly transforms into a harmless expression; no official solution for it was published either, so here's my little contribution to the community. Without further ado, here's its statement translated into English:</p>
<div class="problem">
Prove that if a line intersects the curve \(y=\sqrt[3]{x^2}\) at three points with abscissas \(x_1\), \(x_2\), and \(x_3\), then \(\displaystyle \sqrt[3]{\frac{x_2 x_3}{{x_1}^2}}+\sqrt[3]{\frac{x_3 x_1}{{x_2}^2}}+\sqrt[3]{\frac{x_1 x_2}{{x_3}^2}}\) is constant.
</div>

<p><br>
Before jumping straight into its solution, we need to take a look at a result widely known in math olympiads, not so obvious at first glance. Vieta's formulas relate a polynomial's coefficients to its roots, and can be deduced really quickly.</p>
<p>By the fundamental theorem of algebra (FTA), we can factor out any polynomial \(p\) as \[\begin{align*}
p(x)&amp;=a_n(x-x_1)(x-x_2)\cdots(x-x_n)\\
&amp;=a_n x^n - a_n(x_1 + \ldots + x_n)x^{n-1} + a_n(x_1x_2 + \ldots + x_1x_n)x^{n-2} + \ldots + a_nx_1\cdots x_n,
\end{align*} \tag{1}\] where \(n\) is the degree of \(p\), \(x_i\) its \(i\)th root, and \(a_n\) the coefficient of \(x^n\). Recall also that any polynomial can by definition be expressed as \[p(x)=a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_1 x + a_0 \tag{2};\] so combining equations \((1)\) and \((2)\) we reach the conclussion that \[\sum_{1\leq i_1 &lt; i_2 &lt; \ldots &lt; i_k \leq n} \left(\prod_{j=1}^k x_{i_j}\right) = (-1)^k \frac{a_{n-k}}{a_n}.\]</p>
<p>It's much easier to understand if you do the same procedure -- expand out the FTA form and identify each coefficient -- on a concrete polynomial, but that's it: everything you need to know to understand the solution.</p>
<div class="solution">
Because lines can be described by the equation \(y=ax+b\), we face the equality \(\sqrt[3]{x^2}=ax+b\), which we can reorganize by cubing both sides: \[\begin{align*}
    \sqrt[3]{x^2}=ax+b &\implies x^2 = (ax+b)^3 = a^3 x^3 + 3 a^2 b x^2 + 3 a b^2 x + b^3\\
    &\implies a^3 x^3 + (3 a^2 b -1) x^2 + 3 a b^2 x + b^3 = 0.
\end{align*}\] Now, invoking Vieta's formulas for third-degree polynomials we deduce that, if \(x_1\), \(x_2\) y \(x_3\) are solutions, then \[x_1x_2x_3 = -\frac{b^3}{a^3}\qquad\text{and}\qquad x_1x_2 + x_2x_3 + x_3x_1 = \frac{3ab^2}{a^3} = \frac{3b^2}{a^2}.\] Overall, the given expression starts to cancel out, and simplifies down to \[\begin{align*}
    \sqrt[3]{\frac{x_2 x_3}{{x_1}^2}}+\sqrt[3]{\frac{x_3 x_1}{{x_2}^2}}+\sqrt[3]{\frac{x_1 x_2}{{x_3}^2}} &= -\sqrt[3]{\frac{b^3}{a^3{x_1}^3}}-\sqrt[3]{\frac{b^3}{a^3{x_2}^3}}-\sqrt[3]{\frac{b^3}{a^3{x_3}^3}}\\
    &= -\frac{b}{a} \left(\frac{1}{{x_1}}+\frac{1}{{x_2}}+\frac{1}{{x_3}}\right) = -\frac{b}{a} \cdot \frac{x_1x_2 + x_2x_3 + x_3x_1}{x_1x_2x_3}\\
    &= -\frac{b}{a}\cdot \frac{3b^2/a^2}{-b^3/a^3} = \boxed{3},
\end{align*}\] which is indeed a constant, as we wanted to prove.

<h1 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h1>
<p>I've made this post, not as hatred towards the RSME for abandoning this section, but rather to encourage people to try out their problems and send their solutions, maybe if a large enough amount does so, we'll get the problem of the month back.</p>
<p>My petition is for the RSME to consider how beloved the POTM is, and to do their best to keep it going; if someone is needed to maintain this section, I volunteer to do so, despite not being a math major.</p></div>
